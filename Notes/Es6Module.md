### ES6_Notes

## ES6
- By default in ES6 module `strict mode` enable.
- No need to `Enable` `strict mode`.

### Issue with common js
- when you put inside `require` any path extension like `.js`, `.dasd`, doesn't metter that file extension is correct or not, still import file is work

- but in ES6 this will not work.
